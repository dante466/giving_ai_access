    "response": "The code is part of a JavaScript/React application that interacts with an AI API. Here's an overview:\n\n1. **API Response Handling:**\n   - Sends requests using an API key for authorization.\n   - Retrieves the AI response (`llmResponse`) and logs it.\n   - Updates conversation history with both the user prompt and AI response.\n   - Checks if the response contains \"advice\" and saves it.\n\n2. **Voice Synthesis:**\n   - If voice functionality is enabled, it uses `speechSynthesis` to read the AI response aloud.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - Catches errors during the API request and updates the conversation history with error details.\n\n4. **API Key Management:**\n   - Provides a method to change the API key, updates both the state and local storage.\n\n5. **Prompt Handling:**\n   - Manages prompt changes, possibly adjusting for continuous interaction modes.\n\n6. **Submit Function:**\n   - Handles the submission of prompts, includes checks for on-demand prompts and bounding box data.\n   - Logs actions and manages temporary storage for prompts.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to handle interactive conversational sessions with an AI, incorporating API management, error handling, and optional voice feedback for a seamless user experience."
